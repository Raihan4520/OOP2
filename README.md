# Object-Oriented Programming 2 (C#) Projects

Welcome to the repository for my Object-Oriented Programming 2 (OOP2) course at American International University - Bangladesh (AIUB). This repository contains a series of Windows Forms applications developed using C# and applying key OOP concepts. The final project is an **Airway Ticketing System**, which demonstrates a combination of advanced OOP principles and GUI-based application development.

## Overview

Throughout the course, I developed multiple Windows Forms applications using C# that implement various OOP principles such as:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Event-driven programming

These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of OOP design patterns, user interface development, and connecting the business logic to the GUI.

## Final Project - Airway Ticketing System

The main highlight of this repository is the **Airway Ticketing System** developed as the final project for the course. The application allows users to:

- User can signup and login
- User can book and cancel airline tickets
- User can view available airline tickets
- User can view their booked airline tickets
- Admin can login and manage airline tickets

### Features:
- **User-friendly interface** with forms for ticket booking and management.
- **Real-time validation** for user inputs.

### OOP Concepts Applied:
- **Encapsulation:** Ticketing data is encapsulated within classes, providing clean and maintainable code.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Various user roles and ticket types are handled using inheritance and method overriding.
- **Event Handling:** Real-time interaction with user actions for validation and seat selection.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C#
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Framework:** .NET Framework (Windows Forms)
- **Design Pattern:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## How to Run

To run any of the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
